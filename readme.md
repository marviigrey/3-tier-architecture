A three-tier architecture application is a software architecture that divides an application into three logical layers or tiers, each with a specific role and set of responsibilities. 

The three tiers are typically:

1. Presentation Tier: This is the user-facing layer of the application, responsible for handling user interactions and presenting data to the user. It often includes a graphical user interface (GUI) or web interface that allows users to interact with the application.

2. Application Tier: This is the business logic layer of the application, responsible for processing user requests and managing application data. It often includes a server or middleware layer that performs tasks such as authentication, authorization, and application logic.

3. Data Tier: This is the data storage layer of the application, responsible for managing application data and ensuring its integrity. It often includes a database server or other data storage system that stores and retrieves data as needed.

The three-tier architecture is a popular design pattern for web applications, as it allows for scalability, modularity, and flexibility in the development and deployment of complex software systems.
